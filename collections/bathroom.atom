The Brampton Collection is made for royalty but pay only a fraction of the price by purchasing direct from the manufacturer!ClassicTurkishTowels: All our towels are manufactured and imported from our very own mills in Turkey. We also sell our own line of high end towels, robes, and bath sheets all made with 100% Turkish Cotton. We always use 100% chemical-free high quality unprocessed Turkish combed cotton in all our products.Turkish cotton is prized for its natural long lasting soft texture and luster, which naturally grows in longer, more narrow fibers. This results in more threads per square inch and a natural softer texture without any chemical processing! No other cotton fiber is as naturally soft, absorbent or lustrous without any chemical processing.All purchases are shipped from our own warehouses in the US, so you’ll never wait long for your order. Buy direct from us and save! We stand behind all of our products and accept all unused returns. Please contact us directly so we can accommodate you. Looking for something specific? Contact us and let us know!</td>

    <td colspan="2">Salbakos has been selling Turkish bath towels for more than 35 years and presently has many of the top selling cotton bath towels on the Web. This can't be done without continually providing superb products with great customer service at very fair prices.<br><br><br><br>We believe this is the first towel ever made with this intimate blend of 5% Italian silk and 95% fine Turkish combed cotton. They have been deisgned so the silk will make them incredibly soft and the cotton makes them absorbent. Your constructive feedback is encouraged.<br><br><br><br>All Salbakos towels are VAT dyed which means the dye is infused into the yarns under high pressure and high temperature for 6-12 hours depending upon the color. This limits any fading of even the brightest colors. Even our pure white bath towels are dyed white, not bleach white. For maximum color retention and softness, do not use any bleach or softener when washing. Wash in cold/warm water and tumble dry low.<br><br><br><br>You will feel the softness immediately, and these towels will continually get softer with each washing. And by using only Turkish cotton and double-stitching all the hems the durability is un-equaled. These bath towels should last you many years!<br><br><br><br>In addition, these luxury spa quality bath towels are made in an Oeko-Tex® and ISO 9001 mill. This means that all materials must be chemical and pesticide free and that the mill operates at the highest quality standards and is audited regularly. These certificates are posted in the pictures.<br><br><br><br><ul>
<br><li>Silk and Cotton – 5% Silk and 95% Combed Turkish Cotton Spun Together Into Yarns Making This Towel Super Soft and Highly Absorbent.</li>
<br><li>IMPORTED FROM DENIZLI TURKEY</li>

    <td colspan="2">Soft, luxurious, easy care, and long lasting products direct from the mill Salbakos has been the leader in Turkey's highest quality luxury textiles since its founding in 1993 - ranked #1 out of over 2,000 towel companies in Turkey. Salbakos controls every part of the manufacturing from cotton to weaving to dying to packaging. This assures you get consistent, superb quality. Nearly all other towel sellers are resellers, middlemen, or agents buying from the cheapest factory at the time. We desire a long-term relationship and repeat buyers so we do not cut any corners.<br><br><br><br>Turkish Cotton - Best in the World<br><br><br><br>Turkish cotton is prized for its natural long lasting soft texture and luster.  It naturally grows in longer, more narrow fibers which results in more threads per square inch and a natural softer texture without any chemical processing! No other cotton fiber is as naturally soft, absorbent or lustrous without any chemical processing.<br><br><br><br>5 Star Luxury Hotel and Spa Quality<br><br><br><br>Salbakos towels are sold to 4 and 5 star hotels throughout the world showing that they are made for the most discriminating customer but are durable to withstand commerical laundries and many washings.  Extremely long staple length makes yarns more durable, more absorbent, and with a nicer sheen. Towel is not bulky or heavy so dries quickly preventing the towels from smelling musty and saving time and money in drying.<br><br><br><br>Oeko-Tex Eco-friendly<br><br><br><br>The factory is OekoTex and ISO 9001 Certified. Oekotex means all materials including the cotton are made with no harmful chemicals or pesticides. Oekotex rules are so specific that this certification is considered Organic in many countries.   ISO9001 means strict quality controls have been put in place at the factory which assures defects are documented and limited.<br><br><br><br>Brighter and Whiter<br><br><br><br>Salbakos towels are dyed under enormous pressure for up to 12 hours. Although this is an expensive process, the color penetrates into the deepest part of the cotton fiber keeping the colors bright and lustrous. Most other towels are simply dipped into the dye and lose their brightness after just a few washings.  And only in Turkey are white towels dyed white, not bleached white. Bleach breaks down the cotton fibers and the white starts to look dingy quickly. Not with Salbakos towels which will look bright for many years.<br><br><br><br>Care Instructions<br><br><br><br>Machin wash warm with mild detergent and medium heat.  Wash only with other towels.  To maintain maximum absorbency, do not use fabric softener or dryer sheets.  Dry towels right right away. Tumble dry on medium heat. Do not over-heat Salbakos towels get softer, more luxurious, and more absorbent after each washing.<br><br><br><br>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Are these really 40 x 80 inches? Yes! Unlike other selling similar towels, we do not false advertise.  Wrap up in this extra large towel.  Why are other similar towels less expensive? Other brands use poor quality cotton, usually from Pakistan or China.  With these they also use inexpensive dyes that will fade over time.  Often times they cut a couple inches off of the towels as well so they are not the tru 40 x 80 inch size.  Last but not least, our towels are made in an Oek-tex and ISO9001 certified mill.  Can you use bleach on these towels? No, please do not use bleach on these towels. The bleach will dis-color the colored towels and will make fine cotton less soft and break down the cotton fiber for a shorter life.   Are Salbakos towels chemical free? Yes! all of our towels are Oeko-Tex Certified, meaning that they are chemical-free and pesticide-free.  Can I use fabric softener on these towels? No, do NOT use fabric softener on these towels. Fabric softeners including dryer sheets like Bounce leave a chemical film on the towel, making them less absorbent and shortening the life of the towel.  Do these towels shrink after first wash and dry? Not if laundered properly, we recommend following the Washing and Drying Insturctions listed at...</td>

    <td colspan="2">If you have ever been to an ultra-luxury Turkish bath you will know how nice these towels are and if you have ever tried to buy a really nice peshtemal, your search likely came up short. I looked everywhere but could not find one that was up to my snobby standards, so I worked with my factory in Turkey to develop a peshtemal towel that is over the top: lightweight and versatile, soft and absorbent, beautiful and well made. Only the finest materials are used. No corners were cut and no expense spared.<br><br>These are being sold exclusively on Amazon by American Pillowcase. There is not retailer mark-up so they can be sold at the lowest price possible. Caretag says "Classic Turkish Towels" which is the a brand owned by SALBAKOS. If the caretag does not say Classic Turksih Towels or SALBAKOS, it is not genuine and you should return it and complain to Amazon that you received a counterfeit.<br><br>As part of my commitment to produce only eco-friendly towels, these are manufactured in an OEKO-TEX certified mill. OEKO-TEX is the European organic certification. There is no certifying body in the U.S. for organic textiles, so this is as good as it gets. Google OEKO-TEX if you want to learn more. Please email me with questions or suggestions.<br><br>Add to Cart above now to get one of these in your hands as soon as possible. Considering ordering more than one as they make excellent gifts -- They're sure to impress!<br><ul>
