Yes! Unlike other selling similar towels, we do not false advertise.  Wrap up in this extra large towel.  Why are other similar towels less expensive? Other brands use poor quality cotton, usually from Pakistan or China.  With these they also use inexpensive dyes that will fade over time.  Often times they cut a couple inches off of the towels as well so they are not the tru 40 x 80 inch size.  Last but not least, our towels are made in an Oek-tex and ISO9001 certified mill.  Can you use bleach on these towels? No, please do not use bleach on these towels. The bleach will dis-color the colored towels and will make fine cotton less soft and break down the cotton fiber for a shorter life.   Are Salbakos towels chemical free? Yes! all of our towels are Oeko-Tex Certified, meaning that they are chemical-free and pesticide-free.  Can I use fabric softener on these towels? No, do NOT use fabric softener on these towels. Fabric softeners including dryer sheets like Bounce leave a chemical film on the towel, making them less absorbent and shortening the life of the towel.  Do these towels shrink after first wash and dry?
