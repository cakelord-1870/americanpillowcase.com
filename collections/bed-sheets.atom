To help ensure the fitted sheets stay put, elastic is installed all the way around the edges of the sheets, rather than just in the corners. Thanks to the expert finishing, the fabric's silky softness and smoothness is the perfect addition to your bedroom decor.<br><br>Durable Quality; Built Tough<br><br>These durable sheets are long-lasting and affordable.

Quickly clean up your spill before it has a chance to soak in and your sheet will remain stain free.<br><br>Care Instructions<br><br>When it is time to wash your pre-shrunk sheets, simply toss them into an ordinary washing machine with hot or warm water with mild detergent.  Washing at a warmer temperature allows the microfibers to expand, releasing trapped dirt and micro particles.<br><br>Air dry is best for these products since microfiber dries relatively quickly.

King/Cali King Flat Sheet
Add some luxurious comfort to your bedroom with these American Pillowcase Sheets. These sheets are made of 100% Egyptian cotton with a breathable, soft sateen weave comparable to those found in 5 star hotels around the globe.
300 Thread Count Egyptian Cotton
Our 300 thread count Egyptian cotton is made with a sateen four over one weave allowing for a silky soft feel. These pillowcases feel smooth and fresh providing the comfort you need for quality nights rest.
Thread count references the number of threads per square inch of fabric. Cotton linens with a thread count of 200-400 are known for a soft, clean feel that is breathable and wicks away moisture.
Care Instructions
You should always wash your cotton sheets in a separate load than your normal laundry, as zippers, hooks and buttons could possibly damage cotton linens. A normal wash cycle with a warm temperature setting is recommended. Quality, pH balanced detergents are best when washing fine cotton linens. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens. Removing cotton sheets promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove sheets while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton sheets. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.</td>

This flat sheet is made of 100% Egyptian cotton with a breathable, crisp Percale weave comparable to those found in 5 star hotels around the globe.<br><br>400 Thread Count Percale Egyption Cotton<br><br>Our percale weave cotton sheets are produced using a one over one under pattern, creating a tight weave that pairs long lasting beauty with exceptional strength and durability.<br><br>Thread count references the number of threads per square inch of fabric. Cotton linens with a thread count of 200-400 are known for a crisp, clean feel that is breathable and wicks away moisture. Percale sheets resist pilling, especially in thread counts of 400 or more. These sheets will develop a softer feel with every washing.<br><br>Care Instructions<br><br>You should always wash your cotton percale sheets in a separate load than your normal laundry, as zippers, hooks and buttons could possibly damage cotton linens. A gentle wash cycle with a cold temperature setting, and a mild detergent is recommended. Quality, pH balanced detergents are best when washing fine cotton linens. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens.<br><br>Removing cotton sheets promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove sheets while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton sheets. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.<br><ul>
