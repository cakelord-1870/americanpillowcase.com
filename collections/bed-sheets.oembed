Cotton linens with a thread count of 540 are known for a ultra soft, clean feel that is breathable and wicks away moisture. Cotton sheets resist pilling, especially in thread counts of 400 or more. These sheets will develop a softer feel with every washing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCare Instructions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou should always wash your cotton sheets in a separate load than your normal laundry, as zippers, hooks and buttons could possibly damage cotton linens. Gently wash with warm water and a standard detergent. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens.\u003cbr\u003eRemoving cotton sheets promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove sheets while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton sheets. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e100% Long Staple Cotton 540 Thread Count – Hypoallergenic, Long Staple Yarns Woven is a Sateen Weave Make These Sheets Incredibly Soft and Luxurious\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMEASUREMENTS: FLAT SHEET - 72\" x 102\" - Fits Twin \u0026amp; Twin XL sized beds, generously sized to ensure easy installation\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA SUMPTUOUS SLEEPING EXPERIENCE THAT WON'T BREAK THE BANK - tested better than all major brands for softness, durability, comfort, wrinkle resistance, and beauty at 50% less than department store prices\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWRINKLE RESISTANT - Eco-friendly, proprietary processing to limit wrinkling out of the dryer make this product perfect for any bed in your home\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMATCHING SHAMS AND DUVET COVERS SOLD SEPARATELY - Click on the \"Sold by American Pillowcase\" link below to find matching shams and sheet sets.

Additionally, this helps the linens stay wrinkle free and let you enjoy a smooth finish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe tight weave of these microfibers prevents liquids from soaking in immediately, helping keep these fabrics stain resistant.  Quickly clean up your spill before it has a chance to soak in and your sheet will remain stain free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCare Instructions\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen it is time to wash your pre-shrunk sheets, simply toss them into an ordinary washing machine with hot or warm water with mild detergent.  Washing at a warmer temperature allows the microfibers to expand, releasing trapped dirt and micro particles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAir dry is best for these products since microfiber dries relatively quickly.  If you do need to use a dryer, set it on low or no heat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e100% Brushed Microfiber - Super Soft, Stain and Wrinkle Resistant\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFULL SIZE FITTED SHEET 54\"x75\" - Deep 18\" pockets, Qty 1, Blue\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBRIGHT, VIBRANT COLORS - Matching Flat Sheets and Pillowcases sold separately\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSOFT, BREATHABLE, LIGHTWEIGHT - Cool in the Summer and warm in the Winter\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWRINKLE, FADE, STAIN RESISTANT - No ironing needed\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEASY CARE INSTRUCTIONS: Wash separately.
