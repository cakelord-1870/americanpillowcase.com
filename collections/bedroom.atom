This Percale textile is a classic one-over-one-under weave which makes the fabric cool and crisp to touch. This breathable yet medium weight material keeps you cool in the summer and dry and warm in the winter. High thread count does not mean better quality or comfort, but this 220 count is perfect for maximum comfort and durability. Even for those with sensitive skin. The hypoallergenic qualities will reduce allergens but still showcases a smooth finish for a satin-like surface and luminous sheen. The hems will help prevent falling apart as extra stitches have been added to ensure a long-lasting product.<br><br>Includes: 120 Standard Size Pillow Cases - fits 20"x 26"<br><br>Add some luxurious comfort to your bedroom with these American Pillowcase Pillowcases. These pillowcases are made of 100% Egyptian cotton with a breathable, crisp Percale weave comparable to those found in 5-star hotels around the globe.<br><br>220 Thread Count Percale Egyption Cotton<br><br>Our percale weave cotton pillowcases are produced using a one over one under pattern, creating a tight weave that pairs long lasting beauty with exceptional strength and durability.<br><br>Thread count references the number of threads per square inch of fabric. Cotton linens with a thread count of 200-400 are known for a crisp, clean feel that is breathable and wicks away moisture. Percale linens resist pilling. These linens will develop a softer feel with every washing.<br><br>Care Instructions<br><br>You should always wash your cotton percale pillowcases in a separate load than your normal laundry, as zippers, hooks and buttons could possibly damage cotton linens. A gentle wash cycle with a cold temperature setting, and a mild detergent is recommended. Quality, pH balanced detergents are best when washing fine cotton linens. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens.<br><br>Removing cotton pillowcases promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove pillowcases while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton pillowcases. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.</td>

    <td colspan="2">In response to repeated requests from its Amazon customers, American Pillowcase proudly introduces a high-quality, luxuriously soft set of linens that are RELAXATION READY the moment they come out of the dryer. No detail was overlooked in the careful crafting of these 540 thread count striped linens. The 100% EGYPTIAN COTTON fabric is woven using fine yarns, so although it is a high thread count, it is medium weight and perfect for use on warm or cool nights.     100% cotton fibers are ideal for those with sensitive skin as well as comfort and breath-ability. The fabric is expertly finished to ensure its SILKY SOFTNESS, LUSTROUS SHEEN, and WRINKLE RESISTANCE. We have added more stitches to the hems than any other competitor, ensuring the hems never fall apart. The hypoallergenic qualities will reduce allergens but still showcases a smooth finish for a satin-like surface and luminous sheen.<br><br>Package Includes: Two standard pillowcases - 21" x 32" - Fits a standard-sized 20” x 26” pillow<br><br>Luxury Striped Linens<br><br>Add some luxurious comfort to your bedroom with this American Pillowcase silky weave linen set.

Cotton linens with a thread count of 540 are known for a ultra soft, clean feel that is breathable and wicks away moisture. Cotton sheets resist pilling, especially in thread counts of 400 or more. These sheets will develop a softer feel with every washing.<br><br>Care Instructions<br><br>You should always wash your cotton sheets in a separate load than your normal laundry, as zippers, hooks and buttons could possibly damage cotton linens. Gently wash with warm water and a standard detergent. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens.<br>Removing cotton sheets promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove sheets while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton sheets. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.<br><ul>
