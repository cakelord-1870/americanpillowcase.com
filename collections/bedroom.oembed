If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens.\u003cbr\u003eRemoving cotton sheets promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove sheets while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying.

A gentle wash cycle with a cold temperature setting, and a mild detergent is recommended. Quality, pH balanced detergents are best when washing fine cotton linens. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemoving cotton pillowcases promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove pillowcases while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton pillowcases. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.","brand":"American Pillowcase","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":39325285449880,"sku":"T220-Pillowcase-Wholesale-Box","price":365.65,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0013\/8775\/7686\/products\/medium_bfa2485c-dd2d-49c5-b144-1c4907501ed1.jpg?v=1614932363"},{"product_id":"wholesale-box-of-140-standard-size-microfiber-pillowcases","title":"Wholesale Box of 140 Standard Size Microfiber Pillowcases","description":"Add some comfort to your bedroom with American Pillowcase microfiber pillowcases.
