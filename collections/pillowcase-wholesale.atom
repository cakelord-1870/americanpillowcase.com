    <td colspan="2">100% long staple cotton is breathable to keep you cool in the summer and dry and warm in the winter. 300 thread count is perfect for maximum comfort and durability. This is the exact fabric I sold to 5-star luxury hotels of years. Higher thread count or heavier fabric does not mean better quality or comfort.  Textile experts: the construction is 173x120 using 60 compact yarns in both the warp and the weft - it doesn't get any better. Hypoallergenic will reduce allergens.  Sateen finish for a smooth surface and luminous sheen. Double stitched seams for quality and durability. Perfectly covers your pillow with enough overhang to not see the pillow or you can tuck back into the pillow for a cleaner look.  Easy care - wash in warm water, dry on medium heat, and take out of the dryer as soon as they are done, or just before they are fully dry. If you are at all unsatisfied, simply let us know and you will receive a full refund - no questions asked! Includes: 10 - Dozen pillowcases with 4‚Äù hem</td>
