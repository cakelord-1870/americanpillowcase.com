A normal wash cycle with a warm temperature setting is recommended. Quality, pH balanced detergents are best when washing fine cotton linens. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens. Removing cotton sheets promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove sheets while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton sheets. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRICH COLORS \/ BRIGHT WHITE– Machine wash in cold\/medium temperature water and do not use bleach to limit fading.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e300 THREAD COUNT - Perfect for maximum comfort and durability.

Presently American Pillowcase has 5 of the top selling towels on Amazon. This can't be done without making a superb product at a great price.   Towels made in Turkey are softer and more durable because it is the only country which does not use any bleach in the manufacturing process, including white towels.   All Turkish towels are VAT dyed which means the dye is infused into the yarns under high pressure and high temperature for 6-12 hours depending upon the color. This limits any fading of even the brightest colors. Even white towels are dyed white, not bleach white. For maximum color retention and softness, do not use any bleach when washing these towels.   You will feel the softness immediately, and the towels will get softer after each washing. And by using only Turkish cotton and double-stitching all the hems the durability is un-equaled. These towels should last you many years!   In addition, the towels are made in an Oeko-Tex and ISO 9001 mill. This means that all materials must be chemical and pesticide free and that the mill operated at the highest quality standards and is audited regularly. Email me and I will be happy to send you the certificates.  If for any reason, you would not give these 5 stars, please email and let me know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e100% Genuine Turkish Cotton\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIMPORTED FROM DENIZLI TURKEY\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2 Luxury Bath Sheets 35x70\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMatching bath towels (B00GEGLB5C), hand towels (B00KQQTW0W), washcloth (B00GEFSCKA), bath mats (B00J1O3BZ2), and 6 piece sets (B00K6ORZ6C) available .
