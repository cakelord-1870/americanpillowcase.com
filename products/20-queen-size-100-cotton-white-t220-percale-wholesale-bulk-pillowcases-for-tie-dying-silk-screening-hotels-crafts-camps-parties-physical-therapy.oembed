Cotton linens with a thread count of 200-400 are known for a crisp, clean feel that is breathable and wicks away moisture. Percale linens resist pilling. These linens will develop a softer feel with every washing.\n\nCare Instructions\n\nYou should always wash your cotton percale pillowcases in a separate load than your normal laundry, as zippers, hooks and buttons could possibly damage cotton linens. A gentle wash cycle with a cold temperature setting, and a mild detergent is recommended. Quality, pH balanced detergents are best when washing fine cotton linens. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens.\n\nRemoving cotton pillowcases promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove pillowcases while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton pillowcases. However, some people prefer to iron them for a crisper appearance.","brand":"American Pillowcase","offers":[{"title":"White - Cotton \/ King - Qty 2","offer_id":39291626979480,"sku":"T220 pillowcase king - 2","price":13.29,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"White - Cotton \/ King - Qty 20","offer_id":39291627012248,"sku":"T220 pillowcase king - 20","price":72.45,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"White - Cotton \/ Queen - Qty 20","offer_id":39291627045016,"sku":"T220 pillowcase queen- 20","price":69.06,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"White - Cotton \/ Standard - Qty 120","offer_id":39291627077784,"sku":"T220 pillowcase standard - 120","price":365.65,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"White - Cotton \/ Standard - Qty 2","offer_id":39291627110552,"sku":"T220 pillowcase standard-  2","price":11.68,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"White - Cotton \/ Standard - Qty 20","offer_id":39291627143320,"sku":"FO-1PO0-248L","price":96.3,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0013\/8775\/7686\/products\/medium_c0782fc5-defd-4077-a25c-43e7324c98ef.jpg?v=1614586595","url":"https:\/\/americanpillowcase.com\/products\/20-queen-size-100-cotton-white-t220-percale-wholesale-bulk-pillowcases-for-tie-dying-silk-screening-hotels-crafts-camps-parties-physical-therapy","provider":"American Pillowcase","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
