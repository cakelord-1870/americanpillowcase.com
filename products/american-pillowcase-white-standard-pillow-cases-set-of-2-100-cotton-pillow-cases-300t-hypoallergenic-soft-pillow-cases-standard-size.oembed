A normal wash cycle with a warm temperature setting is recommended. Quality, pH balanced detergents are best when washing fine cotton linens. Do not use chlorinated bleach as it can damage quality cotton bedding fibers. If needed, non-chlorinated bleach can be used with white and ivory cotton linens. Removing cotton sheets promptly after washing will help reduce wrinkling. Shaking linens out before placing them in the dryer will reduce wrinkling also. When drying, use a warm setting, remove sheets while they are still slightly damp and hang to finish drying. Ironing is optional but not usually necessary for cotton sheets...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e100% Egyptian Cotton – Hypoallergenic, Long Staple Yarns Woven in a Sateen Weave Make These Pillowcases Incredibly Soft and Luxurious.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImported\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRICH COLORS \/ BRIGHT WHITE– Machine wash in cold\/medium temperature water and do not use bleach to limit fading.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e300 THREAD COUNT - Perfect for maximum comfort and durability.
